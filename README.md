# Lively Desktop Notes

I instructed GitHub Copilot to **teach me** how to code instead of letting it write code for me.  
It was pretty fun â€” as long as the problems were eventually solved, by myself.

## Project: Notes Manager for Lively Desktop Wallpaper

A **vanilla project** using:
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- Node.js backend

---

## Learning Outcomes

This project helped me realize that I can accomplish what AI can â€” it just takes time.  
(1 agent prompt vs 3 days of work just to fail, only sometimes.)

---

### ðŸ“Œ JavaScript Concepts Learned:
- Arrays and Objects  
- `fetch()` requests  
- `async/await` and Promises  
- DOM manipulation

---

### ðŸ“Œ Node.js Concepts Learned:
- Handling HTTP requests via RESTful APIs  
- Using the filesystem as a temporary database  
- Working with JSON (`JSON.parse`, `JSON.stringify`)  
- How promise chaining works â€” and why to avoid it  
- CORS headers: learned the hard way how important they are



---

It was a satisfying project â€” but there's still **a lot more to learn**.
