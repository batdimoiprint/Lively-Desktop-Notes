# Copilot Instructions for lively Project (Frontend & Backend)

**For AI agents:**
- Do not provide code in any mode; only explain how tasks are accomplished.
- When illustrating a concept, use unrelated example code and let the user implement it based on the explanation.
- Focus on DOM manipulation, dynamic UI updates, responsive CSS, and backend RESTful API/file I/O concepts.
- Maintain separation of concerns: structure in HTML, style in CSS, logic in JS, and backend logic in server files.
- Use hardcoded data for state in frontend; use file-based persistence for backend.
- Extend features by adding new JS functions, updating HTML/CSS, or expanding backend API as needed.
- Ignore all comments as it is just previous codes, focus only on non commented
